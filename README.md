# Candidate Fit Predictor

This is a small Streamlit app that predicts a candidate fit probability using a toy logistic regression model.

Quick start

1. Create and activate a Python 3.11 virtual environment (recommended):

```bash
python3.11 -m venv .venv311
source .venv311/bin/activate
```

2. Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Run the app with Streamlit:

```bash
streamlit run candidate_fit_app.py
```

4. Open `http://localhost:8501` in your browser.

Notes
- Rename or remove any file that shadows `streamlit` imports (e.g. `import streamlit as st.py`).
- This project recommends Python 3.11 for smooth dependency installation.

Deploying
- To publish code: create a GitHub repository and push the code (instructions below).
- To deploy the app online, consider Streamlit Cloud (share.streamlit.io) or Render/Heroku.

License
- Add your license or keep it private if you prefer.
